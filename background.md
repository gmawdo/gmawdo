In today’s increasingly complex and interconnected world, traceability isn’t just an ideal—it’s a necessity.
From mission-critical systems to regulatory oversight, organisations need verifiable proof that processes, assets, and data have evolved as expected.

The software I work on provides a trusted framework for tracking how things evolve, ensuring compliance, and verifying authenticity.

Solving Real-World Challenges
- Aviation Safety: Commercial airline engines generate vast amounts of telemetry data in real-time. This data must be continuously checked against safety rules, batched, and recorded ensuring that every reading confirms the engines are operating within tolerance. Cryptographic proofs are used to attest the underlying telemetry absolutely supports reported conclusions.
- Pharmaceutical Integrity: Vaccines must be transported within strict temperature ranges. This technology can prove, with certainty, that a shipment has never exceeded safe temperature limits, eliminating risks and ensuring compliance.
- Supply Chain Transparency: Whether tracking high-value goods, digital assets, or raw materials, our platform ensures that every transformation, movement, and interaction is provable and auditable.

What This Enables
- Origins & Provenance: Where did this come from? What data or materials contributed to its creation? What were the sources of raw materials used?
- Transformation & Evolution: How has it changed? Who or what has influenced it? These can be virtual transformations as seen in AI pipelines or physical movements.
- Accountability & Compliance: What rules govern its lifecycle? How can we prove conclusions drawn from telemetry, clinical data, or other sources?
- Movement & Delivery: Has it been shipped? Can we trace its journey end-to-end?

By bringing transparency to these processes, we eliminate blind spots, reduce risk, and establish provable trust, whether in regulated industries, AI-driven decision-making, or high-stakes operations.

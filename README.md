# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gary Mawdsley a Mathematician and Computer Scientist!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in the general area of Secure by Design which covers many things including irrefutable audit and memory safety.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working on memory safe, irrefutable audit problems using Rust, zk-SNARKs and blockchain tech stack more generally.
- ðŸš€ I'm interested in the vulnerability and scalability of cross-chain comms and in particular zk-Bridges and Decentralized relayers.

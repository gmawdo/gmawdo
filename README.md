# 👋 Hi, I'm Gary Mawdsley a Mathematician and Computer Scientist!

- 🔭 The focus of my work is on trust and privacy and in particular workflows requiring traceability and proofs.
- 🌱 I’m working on proof and traceability systems using Rust, zk-SNARKs, zk_STARKS, Halo2, and various blockchain tech stacks with particular reference to finality times and costs.
- 🚀 [Here's more info in respect of where my commercial focus is](background.md)

## Contributions
- Engineered an NFS with intrinsic irrefutable audit
- Architected and implemented a series of traceability and proof systems attesting to things from carbon savings to chip design contributions
- AI: Eigenvector approach to detecting human objects in the natural landscape from LIDAR feeds avoiding typical AI training patterns
- Developed ideas and implementation of Theia Cloud adding Kubenetes auto cleanup feature to highly subscribed cloud IDE services
- Co architected and built out the world's first internet banking solution in the late 1990s
- A number of patents relating to enterprise service architectures and secure data storage

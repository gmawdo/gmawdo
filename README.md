# 👋 Hi, I'm Gary Mawdsley a Mathematician and Computer Scientist!
- 🔭 The focus of my work is on trust and privacy and in particular workflows requiring traceability and proofs.
- 🌱 I’m working on proof and traceability systems using Rust, zk-SNARKs, zk_STARKS, Halo2, and various blockchain tech stacks with particular reference to finality times and costs.

For the avoidance of doubt the technology created and the resultant IP craeted from 2018 is owned by one UK entity which has had a number of names during it's 8 year history:
2018 - 2020 DataSignals, *2020 - 2024 Lockular*, **2024 - present Origin Matters**
The name changes represent tech and application pivots.

## Contributions
- Engineered an NFS with intrinsic irrefutable audit
- Architected and implemented a series of traceability and proof systems attesting to things from carbon savings to chip design contributions
- AI: Eigenvector approach to detecting human objects in the natural landscape from LIDAR feeds avoiding typical AI training patterns
- Developed ideas and implementation of Theia Cloud adding Kubenetes auto cleanup feature to highly subscribed cloud IDE services
- Co architected and built out the world's first internet banking solution in the late 1990s
- A number of patents relating to enterprise service architectures and secure data storage

## Patents I've obtained historically as part of my work on projects and indicative of my strategic thinking
- Blockchain based access control using time-dependent obfuscation of access tokens (US,EU) (Access control)
- Private information storage system (US,EU) (Data security)
- Method and apparatus for data obfuscation (US) (Data security)
- Data processing systems and methods (UK) (Microservices, Enterprise Services)

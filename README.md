# 👋 Hi, I'm Gary Mawdsley a Mathematician and Computer Scientist!

- 🔭 I’m currently working in the general area of Secure by Design which covers many things including irrefutable audit and memory safety.
- 🌱 I’m working on memory safe irrefutable audit problems using Rust, zk-SNARKs and blockchain tech.
- 🚀 I'm interested in the vulnerability and scalability of cross-chain comms and in particular zk-Bridges and Decentralized relayers.

# 👋 Hi, I'm Gary Mawdsley a Mathematician and Computer Scientist!
- 🔭 The focus of my work is on trust and privacy and in particular workflows requiring traceability and proofs.
- 🌱 I’m working on proof and traceability systems using Rust, zk-SNARKs, zk_STARKS, Halo2, and various blockchain tech stacks with particular reference to finality times and costs.

For clarity, the technology developed and the resulting IP created since 2018 are owned by a single UK entity, which has undergone several name changes over its 8-year history:  
- **2018 - 2020: DataSignals**  
- **2020 - 2024: Lockular**  
- **2024 - Present: Origin Matters**  

Each name change reflects a strategic pivot in technology and application focus:  
- **DataSignals (2018-2020):** Focused on identifying signals in data, including powerline monitoring and secure distributed data stores with access tracking.  
- **Lockular (2020-2024):** Developed a secure vault for IoT devices and cloud containers, ensuring irrefutable tracking of data generation and data usage.  
- **Origin Matters (2024-Present):** Evolved to incorporate cryptographic proofs for tracking, recognizing that many workflows require verifiable provenance.

## Contributions
- Architected and implemented a series of traceability and proof systems attesting to things from carbon savings to chip design contributions
- Engineered an NFS with intrinsic irrefutable audit
- Developed ideas and implementation of Theia Cloud adding Kubenetes auto cleanup feature to highly subscribed cloud IDE services
- AI: Eigenvector approach to detecting human objects in the natural landscape from LIDAR feeds avoiding typical AI training patterns
- Cofounded a company that developed and patented a microservices and enterprise services orchestration suite
- Co architected and built out the world's first internet banking solution in the late 1990s
  
See the next section below detailing patents obtained as a result of my work over the past two decades

# 👋 Hi, I'm Gary Mawdsley a Mathematician and Computer Scientist!
- 🔭 The focus of my work is on trust and privacy and in particular workflows requiring traceability and proofs.
- 🌱 I’m working on proof and traceability systems using Rust, zk-rollups, zk-SNARKs, Plonk, and various blockchain tech stacks with particular reference to finality times and costs.
- 🚀 [Some commercial applications I'm involved with](background.md)

## Contributions
- 2024-2025: Architected and implemented a series of traceability and proof systems attesting to things from carbon savings to chip design contributions using arkworks libraries
- 2018-2024: Engineered an NFS with intrinsic irrefutable audit using Ethereum, Polkadot and Aleph Zero at various iterations
- 2020-2021: Developed ideas and implementation of Theia Cloud within a Kubenetes env supports 1000s of concurrent users
- 2018-2019: AI: Eigenvector approach to detecting human objects in the natural landscape from LIDAR feeds avoiding typical AI training costs
- 2002-2005: Cofounded a company that developed and patented a microservices and enterprise services orchestration suite
- 1997-2001: Co architected and built out the world's first internet banking solution in the late 1990s

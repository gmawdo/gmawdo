# 👋 Hi, I'm Gary Mawdsley a Mathematician and Computer Scientist!

- 🔭 I’m currently working in the general area of Secure by Design which covers many things including irrefutable audit and memory safety.
- 🌱 I’m working on memory safe, irrefutable audit problems using Rust, zk-SNARKs and blockchain tech stack more generally.
- 🚀 I'm interested trust and traceability across a number of use cases. Some examples are critical infrastructure design, carbon credit proofs, attesting to conclusions drawn from sensitive telemetry and AI.
